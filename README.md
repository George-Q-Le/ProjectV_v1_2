Years after a catastrophic accident on the private colony world, Diadal, life has almost returned to normal, if not for the mess of factions
vying for control over the planet. You are one of the survivors of the calamity, waking up from cryo-sleep fifty years later. Possessing 
cybernetic augmentations that have become extremely rare and valuable after the accident, you have the edge to influence the fate of your 
new home planet. But be careful, since with that great power, there come many wishing to have you on their side or to destroy you. 

Who can you trust? 

Welcome to the world of Diadal, a colony built by Hungarian settlers with the assistance of the UKCS (United Kingdom Colonial Services).
A terraformed exoplanet, Diadal, is a temperate planet on the edge of its system's habitable zone. With a lengthy summer season, Diadal was 
quick to capitalize on its fertile land and favorable weather, formulating a strong colonial economy built on agriculture. However, two 
decades after its founding in 2257, a calamity struck the planet. The incident long forgotten scorched the land and destroyed the space fleet 
defending the once bountiful planet. 

The story should have ended there with the destruction of an entire local civilization.
But of course, humanity has survived much worse.
